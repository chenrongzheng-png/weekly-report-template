# Legend

## Introduction

This is the legend of the templates for the weekly reports that the BIDS interns will be working on. The weekly reports are to be completed every week, keeping the latest report on the top, with older reports below in chronological order.

## Formating

### Housekeeping
* Leave one blank line after each section to keep the report easy to read on GitHub.
* Make sure to start another numbered line after each complete sentence, to make it easy to keep track of the lines. 
* Period after every complete sentence.
* Names in Initials
* Put the latest report at the top so we can scroll down to the oldest reports, starting from the first week.
  
### Basic Syntax
* For the subtitles, use hashtags + space + subtitle.
  * "# A first-level heading"
  * "## A second-level heading"
  * "### A third-level heading"
* Styling
  * Bold: **This is bold text** (or Command+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux))
  * Italic: _This text is italicized_ (or Command+i or Ctrl+i)
  * All Bold and Italic: ***All this text is important***
  * Subscript: This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text.
  * Underline: 	This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text.
* Quoting
  * Quoting text: use >
    * > Text that is a quote.
  * Quoting code in a sentence: use single backticks ` ` (or Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux))
  * Quoting an entire block of codes or commands: use triple backticks ``` ```
* Links
  * Link text in brackets [ ], and the URL in parenthesis ()
    * Please fill out the [application form](https://applicationform.bids.com)
* Image
  * use ![Description of the image](link to the image)
    * ![Here's the preview of the venue](/assets/images/venue.png)
* Lists
  * Bullet Points: add a space after * or - or + and then start your sentence.
  * Ordered list: use numbers 1. 2. 3. etc.
  * Nested Lists: start a new line with two more spaces and use - or *
  * To-do lists: Preface list items with a hyphen - and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x]
    * - [x] Done
      - [ ] Haven't finished yet
* Emoji: use a colon : and the name of your emoji, typing the colon and a letter will pull up a list of recommended emojis.
* Footnotes: [^1] after the content, and then start a new line, add your notes after [^1]:
  * This is a chocolate [^1].
    [^1]: It's a milk chocolate.
* Alerts:use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type, followed by the alert information in a standard blockquote.
  * > [!NOTE]
    > Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
    > [!TIP]
